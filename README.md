# A Podcast Review of *TED Radio Hour*

*TED Radio Hour* is a subsidiary of National Public Radio (NPR) and is hosted by Guy Raz. I've listened to several of their podcasts so far including "Success," "How We Love," and "What is Beauty" which were all about 53 minutes in length. 

*TED Radio Hour* delves further into the concepts established in TED Talks. Each show is centered on a common topic of interest where the speakers of TED talks elaborate on the topics covered in their individual talks. 

## Organization and Pattern

Each podcast is organized in the same way.
- Podcast sponsor ad 
- Introduction to topic of discussion
- Catchy title sequence 
- Speaker introduction by Guy Raz
- Relevant snippet of TED Talk 
- Speaker analyis of snippet and remarks on topic of interest
- Promted questions by Guy Raz
- Speaker responses
- Closing remarks by Guy 
- Commercial break 
- Reintroduction of topic 
- Next speaker introduction

I personally like this template because it's easy to follow and it's clear the podcast has been refined to include only important information. There are no wasted minutes with extra nonessential information. The infomation is also presented in a topical pattern, each speaker has a specific subcatagory within the topic of interest.  

## Style

This podcast uses background music heavily throughout the entire show. The selection of music seems to correspond with what is actually being said in the podcast in hopes to grab listener's emotions more. For example, the show uses a meloncholy riff when talking about Failures in love and being dumped, but uses a higher toned song for a funny segment on calculating love with codes and programs. 

The podcast also adds sound effects to help the listener better visualize a specific situation being explained. For example, the iPhone text notification is used several times to simulate the feeling of getting a text like the study being discussed. 

I found these to be true in every podcast I listened to.

## Narrative Types

This podcast effectively uses narration, interview, and archival material in the following order:

### Pattern
- Narration
- Archival material
- Interview
- Archical material
- Interview
- Narration

I find this circular narrative pattern to be useful in simply following the podcast. The listener is debriefed at the beginning and ending of each subcatagory segment.
